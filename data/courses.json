        "details": "This is a fun project-based course to learn how to create awesome layouts using the Tailwind CSS framework and get comfortable using utility classes over something like Bootstrap, which uses component-based classes. Let's take a look at the outline for this course...We don't want to jump right into the projects, though you certainly could if you want. So the first two sections, we will be working in a coding sandbox. In every new video in these sections, we will have a new file to experiment with and learn all about a certain aspect of Tailwind. For example, we will have pages/videos for colors, typography, spacing, flex classes, and much more. This allows us to essential touch on all parts of Tailwind in a specific order, rather than just jumping right into projects.Next, we will take what we learn in the sandbox environment and use it to create some small projects. These are things that will take 10 - 20 minutes to create and we will do it all in one video per project. The mini-projects include.Next, we will start to work on larger landing-page websites. This will really put what you learned to the test. There will be 6 different websites. They are all very modern and clean-looking. We partnered with Frontend Mentor for the designs. Some projects will have a bit of javaScript for things like hamburger menus, tabs, and some validation. Let's take a look at the projects."

        "details": "We start off with Git Essentials.  The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.  We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.  Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).  The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like committing and branching and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.    We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.  We end with a detailed look at branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.Then we move on to out Next Level Git unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as core as the Git Essentials.  We start with a comprehensive look at the gif diff command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!  We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.  Then we shift our focus to stashing with the git stash command, a convenience command that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.  Finally, we dive deep into undoing changes and time traveling with Git.  We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.  We cover git commands that help us undo changes including git checkout, git restore, git reset, and git revert."
